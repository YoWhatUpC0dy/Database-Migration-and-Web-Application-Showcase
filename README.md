# Database-Migration-and-Web-Application-Showcase

This repository serves as a demonstration of my skills in converting an MS Access database to SQL, along with a simple web application built using Flask to interact with the SQL database.

## Database Conversion

- The `DatabaseConversion` folder contains SQL scripts that demonstrate the process of migrating an MS Access database to SQL.
- `access_to_sql_script.sql` provides a step-by-step script to convert an MS Access database to SQL.
- Each script is well-documented to explain the purpose of each step.

## SQL Queries

- The `SQLQueries` folder includes sample SQL queries for retrieving and manipulating data in the converted SQL database.
- `select_data.sql` and `update_records.sql` are examples of SQL queries for common data operations.
- Each query is accompanied by clear explanations.

## Web Application

- The `WebApp` folder showcases a simple web application developed using Flask.
- It connects to the SQL database, executes SQL queries, and displays results.
- The application includes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.
- Detailed documentation for running the web application can be found in the `WebApp/README.md` file.

## Setup

- The `Setup` folder includes step-by-step instructions for setting up the database conversion environment.
- It provides information about required software, configurations, and dependencies.
